# Zweisprachig — rules for Claude Code

App: static page `public/index.html` + serverless `api/write.js` (Groq → OpenRouter → Gemini fallback, all free). Hosted on Vercel, repo on GitHub.

## Every iteration
1. Make the change. Keep it small and focused.
2. Test locally: `npx vercel dev` → http://localhost:3000
3. Ship: `./ship.sh "<type>: <summary>" [patch|minor|major]`
   - types: feat, fix, style, refactor, docs, chore
   - patch = fixes, minor = features, major = breaking
4. Report the version and the live URL.

## Bigger changes
Create a branch `feat/<name>`, push, open a PR with `gh pr create --fill` → Vercel posts a preview link. Merge to main to go live.

## Never
- Commit secrets or `.env*` files. The key lives only in Vercel env vars.
- Push directly if tests/local run fail.
